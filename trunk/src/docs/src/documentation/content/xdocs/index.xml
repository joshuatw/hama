      <td><strong>Hama</strong> (means a hippopotamus in Korean) is a 
      parallel matrix computational package,
      which provides an library of matrix operations for the large-scale
      processing development environment and Map/Reduce framework for
      the large-scale Numerical Analysis and Data Mining, which need the
      intensive computation power of matrix inversion, e.g. linear regression,
      PCA, SVM and etc.
      It will be also useful for many scientific applications, e.g. physics
      computations, linear algebra, computational fluid dynamics, statistics,
      graphic rendering and many more.
