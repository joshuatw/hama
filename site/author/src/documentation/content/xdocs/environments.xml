    <title>Code Style</title>
    <p>
    The following sections show how to set up the code style for Hama in Eclipse. 
    It is strongly preferred that patches use this style before they are supplied.
    <br /><br />
    <a href="hama-eclipse-formatter.xml">Download hama-eclipse-formatter.xml</a>.
    <br /><br />
    After this, select Window > Preferences, and open up the configuration for 
    Java > Code Style > Code Formatter. Click on the button labeled Import... 
    and select the file you downloaded. Give the style a name, and click OK.

    <title>Subversion Access</title>
    <p>
    This project's Apache Subversion repository can be checked out through SVN with the 
    following instruction set: <br /><br /> 
    svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/hama hama<br /><br />
    (Warning: This is a generic Subversion checkout command which will pull all modules, 
    tags and/or branches of the project. Please refer to project home page for specific 
    SVN instructions, or use "Browse Repository" link; in most cases, you will want to 
    add '/trunk' to the HTTPS URL above to check out only trunk (main development line)). 
    <br /><br />
    <strong>NOTE</strong>: UNIX file and directory names are case sensitive.
